title: "How does Promoted protect your metrics logging data?"
---

We have two log concepts:



<Card title="Profiles logs" icon="user" icontype="duotone">
  these contain sensitive information and are designed to be mutated depending on User requests. An example of a Profile record is our User log record.
</Card>
<Card title="Transactions logs" icon="arrow-right-arrow-left" icontype="duotone">
  these are designed not to contain sensitive information. Theyâ€™re also designed to be immutable and easy to separate from the actual user.
</Card>

In order to make it easy to detach data and recommendations from specific users, we introduce a separate user ID, called a retained_user_id, which you can think of as pseudoanonymized user_id. Retained_user_ids can be kept in User tables or on devices. When a user wants to be forgotten, you delete the association of the user to retained_user_id.
