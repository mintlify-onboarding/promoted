Here are unique Promoted terms that your team will encounter during the integration.

<Card title="Delivery API" icon="truck-ramp-box" icontype="duotone">
  Our API that does matching / ranking. It delivers content.
</Card>
<Card title="Insertion" icon="rectangle-history-circle-plus" icontype="duotone">
  An item in a response list. We start with more potential Request Insertions, then narrow down to a subset of Response Insertions to return to the UI. Insertions differ from Impressions because Insertions may not get viewed.
</Card>
<Card title="Impression" icon="face-thinking" icontype="duotone">
  When an item is viewed on a screen long enough to count as an impression. E.g. >50% visible for >1s.
