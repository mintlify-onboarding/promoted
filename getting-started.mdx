## 5 minute summary for Promoted integration

![](/images/Integration.webm)

Here are unique Promoted terms that your team will encounter during the integration.

* Delivery API \- Our API that does matching / ranking. It delivers content.
* Insertion \- An item in a response list. We start with more potential Request Insertions, then narrow down to a subset of Response Insertions to return to the UI. Insertions differ from Impressions because Insertions may not get viewed.
* Impression \- When an item is viewed on a screen long enough to count as an impression. E.g. >50% visible for >1s.
