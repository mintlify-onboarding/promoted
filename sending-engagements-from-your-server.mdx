title: "Sending Engagements From Your Server"
description: "Your servers can log records using Promoted's Metrics API. The [Metrics API accepts LogRequest proto messages as JSON HTTP requests](https://github.com/promotedai/schema/search?q=%22message+LogRequest%22)."
---

This is useful when:

* Logging purchase actions securely from your server.
* If you are trying to reuse existing log streams. Promoted recommends using our client-side SDKs directly (includes better utilities and less likely to have errors).

Here's an example for logging a purchase to Promoted. The [LogRequest message](https://github.com/promotedai/schema/search?q=%22message+LogRequest%22) supports batch logging records.

```bash Shell
echo '{  
  "userInfo": {  
    "logUserId": "0ea9657c-bd64-4709-9cc0-fbbcdd8d9f43",
    "userId": "user1"
  },  
  "action": [  
    {  
      "actionId": "b59b77c7-a55a-4f01-91b5-58a3d4e36876",  
      "timing": {
        "clientLogTimestamp": 1641038400000
      },
      "actionType": "PURCHASE",
      "insertionId": "b59b77c7-a55a-4f01-91b5-58a3d4e36876",
      "contentId": "123",
      "impressionId": "cb97da40-1c56-45fc-b8c5-c525c384ae48",
      "cart": {
        "contents:" [
          {
            "contentId": "abc",
            "quantity": 1,
            "pricePerUnit": {
              "currencyCode": "USD",
              "amountMicros":  10000000
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]  
}' > /tmp/action.json

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "x-api-key: yourapikey" --data "@/tmp/impression.json" http://www.promoted.ai/log
```

In this example:

* `logUserId` is the anonymous user ID that matches the other log records. Usually this needs to be plumbed through more code paths.
* `amountMicros` is the currency amount (e.g. `$`s) multiplied by 1 million. This let's us keep money values as longs.
