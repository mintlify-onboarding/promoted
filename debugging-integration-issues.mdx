## Missing or incorrect `anonUserId`

### The Problem
Promoted uses `anonUserId` to create personalized recommendations. `anonUserId` is also used as part of the key in the Delivery page database. If the `anonUserId` is not specified, Promoted does not know how to differentiate one user from another. If the `anonUserId` changes during paging, Promoted treats these as two completely different paged Requests.

To be safe, when `anonUserId` is missing, Promoted defaults to falling back to client-specific retrieval ranking. If this is an issue, please chat with Promoted's team. Promoted can walk you through alternatives and the additional information that is needed.

## Likely top causes
Missing `anonUserId` is mostly an issue on web. Mobile apps usually initialize `anonUserId` very early on.

Common causes:

- Race condition in web app loading and `anonUserId` initialization.
   - Example: If the list of content is pre-loaded on the first HTTP request for the index.html and the `anonUserId` is not initialized until after the html is executed on the browser-side.
   - Example: Extra async Javascript needs downloaded after page load to initialize the `anonUserId`.
- The code that creates the `anonUserId` is blocked. E.g. if Segment is used to create a `anonUserId`, then privacy protectors that block Segment will cause `anonUserId` to not be set.
- General coding bugs.

## How will this issue be detected?
Promoted tracks the rate of missing `anonUserId`s. Promoted will report big changes to the "missing `anonUserId` rate" to you.

You might notice this internally if the items do not appear re-ranked. If `anonUserId` changes in between page calls, Promoted might duplicate content across pages.

## Investigation steps
Set up logging in your code to catch when `anonUserId`s are not specified.
Audit the code flow from `anonUserId` to Promoted SDK calls.
If there are interesting dimensions that might impact the problem (e.g. device, browser, authenticated `userId`), forward the values on Delivery calls and Impression records so Promoted can compare the missing `anonUserId` rates along the dimensions.
See if this is an issue on the first page that a user visits vs subsequent pages.
