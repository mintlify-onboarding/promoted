title: "Why use server-side SDKs?"
---

Promoted has “Server Libraries” SDKs for ranking and logging existing ranks to Promoted. Promoted recommends using these SDKs because:

* The SDKs simplify the configuration logic for when to log vs calling Promoted’s Delivery API. This is useful when running experiments.
* The SDKs handle RPC failures and how to log this to Promoted.
* The SDKs easily manage the delivery of Shadow Traffic to Promoted Delivery API.
