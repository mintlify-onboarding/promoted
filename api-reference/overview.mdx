title: "API Overview"
description: "When possible, use the Promoted SDKs instead of the APIs directly. Delivery and Metrics APIs use Protobuf schemas, which are open source. See the [Promoted Protobuf Schema Github Repo](https://github.com/promotedai/schema) for detailed and exact technical API documentation for Delivery and Metrics."

| Delivery API            | Matches content to the requesting user.       | Instead of calling the API directly, use the [server-side SDKs](/api-reference/server-sdk).                                     |
| Metrics API             | Used to log records to Promoted.              | In your [proxy FE logging call](/how-to-your-web-events-with-promoted-metrics), send batches of log records to Metrics API.                         |
| [Content API](api-reference/about-content-apis.mdx)             | Sending Content and User data asynchronously. | - After database writes (change data capture). <br /> - At the end of your mutate API calls. <br /> - Batch cron |
| Manager API - [Prototype](http://promotedai-web.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/manager-graphql/) | CRUD on Manager entities                      | Limited alpha access only. If you want to use, please contact Promoted.                            |

## API Interface
The easiest way to send messages to Promoted APIs is to send JSON over HTTP. The API servers convert the JSON to a Protocol Buffers representation. Some services support sending Protocol Buffer bytes to reduce latencies.
