description: "When possible, use the Promoted SDKs instead of the APIs directly. Delivery and Metrics APIs use Protobuf schemas, which are open source. See the Promoted Protobuf Schema Github Repo for detailed and exact technical API documentation for Delivery and Metrics."

## API Interface
The easiest way to send messages to Promoted APIs is to send JSON over HTTP. The API servers convert the JSON to a Protocol Buffers representation. Some services support sending Protocol Buffer bytes to reduce latencies.
